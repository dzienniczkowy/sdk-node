# VULCAN UONET+ JavaScript SDK

[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/wulkanowy/sdk-node?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

This project aims to allow access to the VULCAN UONET+ with a JavaScript backend tool (like **Node.js**). Support for the browser environment might be limited, as CORS policies might block access to the UONET+ website from your front-end code.

The goal is to combine the **MOBILE** API (used for Dzienniczek+) and **SCRAPPER** of the website, as well as a **HYBRID** mode combining both modes.

## Work in progress

Please note: the SDK is not ready to use in your project yet. At the moment it may be unstable and there are a lot of missing features.

**We do not guarantee backward compatibility during the development**
